name: Parse SSH known_hosts
description: |
  When a user connects to a remote computer via SSH, the remote computer's "host key" (unique identifier) is stored
  locally. This key is used on future connections to avoid reauthenticating. A hacker can use this key to perform
  man-in-the-middle attacks.
